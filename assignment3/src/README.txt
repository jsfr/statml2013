To run the source code:
    - Install Matlab 2013a (other versions of Matlab may also work, but no gurantees are given).
    - Make sure you have the Matlab part of the LIBSVM library in 'lib/libsvm' under 'src'
    - Start Matlab and run the file main.m
    - In the directory containing the 'src' directory must be a 'figures' directory
    - In the same directory as main.m should be the included m-files containing functions used. These are:
        - backPropagation.m
        - betterPlots.m
        - crossValidation.m
        - fNorm.m
        - meanSquaredError.m
        - neuralNetwork.m
        - numericalDiffs.m
        - steepestDescent.m
