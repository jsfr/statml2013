To run the source code:
    - Install Matlab 2013a (other versions of Matlab may also work, but no gurantees are given).
    - Start Matlab and run the file main.m
    - In the same directory as main.m should be the included m-files containing functions used. These are:
        - betterPlots.m
        - fNorm.m
        - getClass.m
        - lda.m
        - linearRegression.m
        - maxPosterior.m
    - NB: in the directory containing the 'src' directory must be a 'figures' directory
